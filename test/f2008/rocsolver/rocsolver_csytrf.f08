! csytrf example (Bunch-Kaufman symmetric factorization, single complex)
! see: https:!rocm.docs.amd.com/projects/rocSOLVER/en/latest/
!
! Factorizes a complex SYMMETRIC matrix (A = A^T, not Hermitian) and checks the
! algorithm succeeded (info == 0). rocSOLVER writes info to DEVICE memory, so it
! is read back from a device allocation (this is what the test exercises).
