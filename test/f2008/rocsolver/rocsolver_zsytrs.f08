! zsytrs example (solve A*X = B for a symmetric matrix, single complex)
! see: https:!rocm.docs.amd.com/projects/rocSOLVER/en/latest/
!
! Self-verifying: factorize a complex SYMMETRIC A (A = A^T) with sytrf, then solve
! A*x = b with sytrs for a right-hand side built from a known solution, and check
! that the recovered x matches. rocSOLVER writes info to DEVICE memory.
!
! sytrf has array overloads (exercised here via array pointers); sytrs is
! c_ptr-only, so the same device arrays are passed to it with c_loc.
