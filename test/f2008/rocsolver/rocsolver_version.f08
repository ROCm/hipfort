! rocSOLVER library version query (Fortran 2008 interfaces)
!
! Exercises the pair rocsolver_get_version_string_size / rocsolver_get_version_string.
!
! rocsolver_get_version_string_size declares its `len` dummy as a bare
! `integer(c_size_t)` (by reference), so the Fortran variable is passed
! DIRECTLY -- not wrapped in c_loc. The test seeds that variable with the
! sentinel -1 and checks it really was written through, which is exactly the
! regression an incorrect out-argument classification would cause.
!
! rocsolver_get_version_string takes `type(c_ptr),value :: buf` and
! `integer(c_size_t),value :: len`, so the buffer address and the capacity are
! passed by value.
!
! Pass/fail: the reported minimum buffer size must be strictly positive, must
! fit in our fixed buffer, and must be large enough for the returned string
! plus its NUL terminator; the string itself must be non-empty and look like a
! dotted version number. Any violation prints "FAILED! ..." and stops with 1.
!
! No handle, no rocsolver_setup and no device memory are needed for this query,
! so the f2003 and f2008 variants are identical apart from the banner.
