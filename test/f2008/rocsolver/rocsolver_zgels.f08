! zgels example (double-complex least-squares solve)
! see: https:!rocm.docs.amd.com/projects/rocSOLVER/en/latest/reference/lapack.html
!
! Self-verifying: pick a known solution x, form b = A*x for a square
! nonsingular A, solve the least-squares problem with gels, and confirm the
! overwritten B recovers x.
!
! NOTE: gels writes `info` to DEVICE memory, so info is backed by a device
! allocation and passed as c_loc(dInfo); passing a host scalar faults on the GPU.
