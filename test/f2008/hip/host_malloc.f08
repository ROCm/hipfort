! HIP runtime hipHostMalloc (pinned host memory, Fortran 2008 interfaces)
! see: https:!rocm.docs.amd.com/projects/HIP/en/latest/
!
! Allocates pinned host memory as a native Fortran array pointer, uses it as the
! source of a host->device copy, copies back into a plain host array and
! verifies the round trip.
