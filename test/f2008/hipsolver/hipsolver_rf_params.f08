! hipSOLVER refactorization (Rf) parameter queries, Fortran 2008 interfaces.
!
! Exercises the getters of the hipsolverRfHandle_t: hipsolverRfGetMatrixFormat,
! hipsolverRfGetNumericProperties, hipsolverRfGetNumericBoostReport,
! hipsolverRfGetResetValuesFastMode and hipsolverRfGet_Algs. All eight of their
! output scalars are declared BARE (by reference) in the binding, so the test
! passes the Fortran variables directly, never c_loc(...).
!
! No sparse matrix setup is needed: hipsolverRfCreate alone produces a handle
! whose parameters are already at their documented defaults. Because this test
! touches no device memory, it is identical to its Fortran 2003 counterpart
! apart from the banner.
!
! How it decides pass/fail: every output variable is poisoned with a value the
! library can never legitimately return (-1, or -1.0d0), then the getter is
! called and the result is compared against the documented default. A variable
! that still holds its poison proves the by-reference argument was not written,
! which is exactly the regression this test guards against. The two-output
! getters (matrix format, numeric properties, algorithms) additionally pin down
! two distinct values -- hipsolverRfGet_Algs must return 0 for the
! factorization algorithm and 1 for the triangular solve algorithm -- so the
! second bare out-arg is demonstrably written independently of the first.
!
! NOTE: on ROCm the hipsolverRfSet* entry points return
! HIPSOLVER_STATUS_NOT_SUPPORTED, so a set/get round-trip is not possible and
! the test deliberately queries the defaults only.
