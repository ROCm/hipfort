! hipsolver syevjInfo query test (Fortran 2008 interfaces)
! see: https:!rocm.docs.amd.com/projects/hipSOLVER/en/latest/
!
! Exercises the Jacobi-convergence getters hipsolverXsyevjGetResidual and
! hipsolverXsyevjGetSweeps (plus their hipsolverDnXsyevj* aliases), whose
! output arguments are now plain Fortran scalars passed directly, not
! c_loc(...) wrappers.
!
! The same 3x3 symmetric system is solved twice with hipsolverDsyevj, the two
! runs differing only in hipsolverXsyevjSetMaxSweeps. That makes the getters'
! outputs provably data-dependent rather than constant:
!   run 1 caps the solver at 1 sweep  -> few sweeps, a large residual
!   run 2 allows up to 100 sweeps     -> more sweeps, a residual near zero
! Both out-arguments are poisoned (-1) before every read so a binding that
! failed to write them would be caught. We then assert sweeps/residual order,
! that the Dn aliases report the identical values, and that run 2's
! eigenvalues really are 2-sqrt(2), 2, 2+sqrt(2).
!
! f2008 style: device buffers are Fortran pointers filled by hipMalloc with
! source=/mold=; syevj has no array-pointer overload, so they are handed to
! the C-binding routines through c_loc. The getters themselves take plain
! scalars in both dialects.
