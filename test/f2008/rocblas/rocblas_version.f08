! Exercises the rocBLAS version query pair:
!
!   * rocblas_get_version_string_size(len) - 'len' is a bare (by reference)
!     integer(c_size_t) output dummy, so the variable is passed directly and
!     NOT wrapped in c_loc().
!   * rocblas_get_version_string(buf,len) - 'buf' is type(c_ptr),value and
!     'len' is integer(c_size_t),value, so a c_loc() and a by-value capacity.
!
! The test passes when the two routines agree with each other: the number of
! characters rocBLAS writes before the NUL terminator must be exactly
! len-1 as reported by rocblas_get_version_string_size, the string must look
! like a version (leading digit, at least two '.'), and an undersized buffer
! must be rejected with rocblas_status_invalid_size. Any violation prints
! "FAILED! <why>" and stops with exit code 1.
