    ! dscal have byte-identical C signatures, differing only in which symbol
    ! they bind to. Sharing alpha's real part (1.5) with zscal makes the two
    ! routines directly comparable: zscal yields (2i, -i) where this yields
    ! (1.5i, -1.5i), so a crossed binding produces a visibly wrong vector.
