! zunmqr example (double-complex multiplication by Q from a QR factorization,
! Fortran 2003 interfaces)
! see: https:!rocm.docs.amd.com/projects/rocSOLVER/en/latest/reference/lapack.html
!
! Self-verifying: factorize A with geqrf to obtain Q (as Householder vectors),
! then apply Q and Q**H successively to a matrix C. Since Q**H * Q = I, the
! result must recover the original C, so no reference matrix is needed.
!
! f2003 style: device buffers are type(c_ptr) allocated by byte count; host
! data is moved with hipMemcpy + c_loc.
