! Round-trip test of rocsolver_set_alg_mode / rocsolver_get_alg_mode.
!
! rocsolver_get_alg_mode takes its `mode` argument by reference (a bare
! `integer(kind(rocsolver_alg_mode_gpu))` dummy, not `type(c_ptr),value`), so
! the variable must be passed DIRECTLY -- never wrapped in c_loc().
!
! The test sets a mode for a function, resets the local variable to the
! sentinel -1, reads the mode back and requires an exact match.  Because the
! sentinel is restored before every get, a getter that fails to write through
! the reference is caught immediately.  Because two (resp. three) DISTINCT
! modes are exercised per function, a getter that returns a constant or a
! setter that is ignored is caught as well.  No default mode is asserted:
! defaults are not portable across GPUs.
