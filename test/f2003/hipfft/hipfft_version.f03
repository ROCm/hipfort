! Demonstrates the hipFFT library version queries hipfftGetVersion and
! hipfftGetProperty.
!
! hipfftGetVersion takes its output argument as a plain Fortran scalar
! (integer(c_int) :: version), so the variable is passed DIRECTLY, not via
! c_loc. hipfftGetProperty is reached through the generic interface, which
! accepts a target integer(c_int) scalar and applies c_loc internally.
!
! Pass/fail: every output variable is poisoned with -12345 beforehand, so a
! binding that never writes through is caught. The real assertion is the
! cross-check that the single packed number returned by hipfftGetVersion
! equals major*10000 + minor*100 + patch assembled from three independent
! hipfftGetProperty queries. Any mismatch prints "FAILED! ..." and STOP 1.
