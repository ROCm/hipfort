! Exercises the hipBLAS version/property query API:
!   hipblasCreate / hipblasGetVersion / hipblasGetProperty / hipblasDestroy.
!
! hipblasGetVersion now takes an `integer(c_int) :: version` output dummy by
! reference, so the variable is passed DIRECTLY (no c_loc). hipblasGetProperty
! still takes `type(c_ptr),value :: myValue`, so c_loc IS required there.
!
! The test passes when:
!   1. hipblasGetVersion overwrites the sentinel with a positive version,
!   2. that packed version decomposes into a plausible major/minor/patch,
!   3. the decomposition agrees with the three hipblasGetProperty queries
!      (two independent APIs must report the same version), and
!   4. hipblasGetVersion with a NULL handle (explicitly allowed) agrees too.
! Any mismatch prints "FAILED! ..." and stops with exit code 1.
