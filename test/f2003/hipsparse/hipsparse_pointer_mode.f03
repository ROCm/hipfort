! hipsparseGetPointerMode / hipsparseSetPointerMode round trip
! (Fortran 2003 interfaces)
! see: https:!rocm.docs.amd.com/projects/hipSPARSE/en/latest/
!
! hipsparseSetPointerMode takes the mode by value, while hipsparseGetPointerMode
! receives it as a plain scalar output argument (not a type(c_ptr)), so the
! variable is passed directly rather than wrapped in c_loc.
!
! The test asserts that the handle starts in HOST pointer mode, that switching
! to DEVICE mode is observed by the getter, and that switching back to HOST is
! observed as well. Before every query the local variable is reset to a -1
! sentinel, so a getter that silently writes nothing is detected instead of
! being hidden by a value left over from the preceding step.
!
! No device memory is involved, so the f2003 and f2008 variants only differ in
! the banner text.
