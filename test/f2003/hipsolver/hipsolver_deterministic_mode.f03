! hipSOLVER handle attribute round-trip (Fortran 2003 interfaces)
! see: https:!rocm.docs.amd.com/projects/hipSOLVER/en/latest/
!
! Exercises the pure "query the handle" entry points, which have no test
! coverage otherwise:
!   hipsolverSetDeterministicMode / hipsolverGetDeterministicMode
!   hipsolverDnSetDeterministicMode / hipsolverDnGetDeterministicMode
!   hipsolverSetStream / hipsolverGetStream
!   hipsolverDnSetStream / hipsolverDnGetStream
!
! The getters take their output argument BY REFERENCE (a bare
! integer(kind(HIPSOLVER_DETERMINISTIC_RESULTS)) and a bare type(c_ptr)),
! so the variable is passed directly, never wrapped in c_loc.
!
! Pass/fail: the mode variable is poisoned with -99 before every get, so a
! getter that writes nothing is caught. Each set/get pair must round-trip the
! exact enum that was stored, the Dn aliases must observe the same handle
! state as the non-Dn entry points, and the stream pointer must come back
! both as the stream that was set and as NULL after the stream is cleared.
! Any mismatch prints "FAILED! ..." and stops with exit code 1.
