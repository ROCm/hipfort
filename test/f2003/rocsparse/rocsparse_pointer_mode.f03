! Exercises rocsparse_get_pointer_mode, whose 'pointer_mode' argument is now a
! plain output scalar (passed directly, not through c_loc).
!
! The test performs three round trips on a freshly created handle:
!   1. the default pointer mode must be rocsparse_pointer_mode_host,
!   2. after rocsparse_set_pointer_mode(..., device) the getter must report device,
!   3. after switching back to host the getter must report host again, which proves
!      the getter genuinely re-reads the handle instead of latching a single value.
! Before every query 'pmode' is poisoned with -1 so that a binding which never
! writes the argument cannot accidentally pass. Any mismatch prints FAILED! and
! stops with a non-zero exit code. No device memory is involved.
