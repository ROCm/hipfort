! hipfort_check (Fortran 2003 interfaces)
!
! A <lib>Check returns on success and, on any other status, prints the status by
! name and its code, then stops with exit code 1. CTest matches that message.
!
! hipblasCheck is used on purpose from a program linked against the HIP runtime
! only: hipfort_check must not reference any library symbol, so the check
! helpers of every library are available without linking that library.
