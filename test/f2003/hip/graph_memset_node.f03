! HIP graph memset node built from a hipMemsetParams struct (Fortran 2003)
! see: https:!rocm.docs.amd.com/projects/HIP/en/latest/
!
! Adds a memset node to a graph via hipGraphAddMemsetNode (which takes a
! hipMemsetParams derived type), instantiates and launches it, and verifies the
! device buffer was set. Complements the memcpy-node / stream-capture graph
! tests with the struct-parameterised node API.
