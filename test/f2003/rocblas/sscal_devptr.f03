! rocblas sscal example, device pointer mode (x = alpha*x)
!
! Device-pointer-mode variant of sscal.f03. The handle is switched to
! rocblas_pointer_mode_device and alpha is staged in device memory, so rocBLAS
! reads the scalar with a device load rather than a host one. That is what
! exercises the type(c_ptr),value scalar binding end to end; the host-mode
! sibling only proves it compiles.
!
! The expected value is still computed from the HOST alpha, so a library that
! read the scalar from host memory would produce a wrong answer rather than pass.
