! Exercises the rocBLAS handle query routines, i.e. the getters whose output
! scalar is now a plain Fortran dummy argument instead of a type(c_ptr),value.
!
! Three independent properties are asserted:
!   (a) rocblas_get_stream returns, bit for bit, the HIP stream that was handed
!       to rocblas_set_stream.  'stream' is passed by value, 'got' is a bare
!       type(c_ptr) that rocBLAS fills in, so it is passed directly.
!   (b) rocblas_pointer_to_mode classifies a genuine hipMalloc'd allocation as
!       rocblas_pointer_mode_device and a plain Fortran host array as
!       rocblas_pointer_mode_host.  It is a pure query function returning the
!       mode (not a status), so it is not wrapped in rocblasCheck.
!   (c) The int64 batch stride setters/getters round-trip: a fresh handle
!       reports 0, the values written with rocblas_set_batch_{alpha,beta}_stride
!       are read back by the matching getters (bare integer(c_int64_t) dummies),
!       and resetting them to 0 leaves the handle in its documented default.
!
! Any mismatch prints "FAILED! ..." and stops with exit code 1; otherwise the
! test prints "PASSED!" together with the strides it recovered.
