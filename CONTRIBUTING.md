# HIPFort

## What do I need to know to help?
If you are looking to help to with a code contribution, hipfort uses the following languages and tools :
* Fortran (2008 standard and above; ISO C Binding)
* [HIP](link needed)
* [CUDA](link needed)
* [CMake](link needed)

In addition to code contribtutions, there are other ways you can help. If you're a hipfort user and have feature requests or bugs to report, open an issue to start a discussion with the maintainers.

We are also in need of example use cases and additional documentation to make use of hipfort.
